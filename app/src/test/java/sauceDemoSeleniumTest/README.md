# Selenium Test Demo with Java and JUnit

This project demonstrates how to write automated tests using **Selenium WebDriver**, **Java**, and **JUnit 5**. The tests are written against the [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website, a demo e-commerce platform designed for testing purposes.

## **Why These Tests?**

The purpose of this project is to provide a practical example of how to:
1. Set up a Selenium WebDriver project using **Gradle**.
2. Write automated tests in **Java** using the **JUnit 5** testing framework.
3. Interact with web elements (e.g., login forms, buttons, dropdowns) using Selenium.
4. Perform assertions to validate test outcomes.
5. Structure tests in a maintainable and scalable way.

This project is ideal for:
- Beginners learning Selenium and Java.
- Developers looking for a reference implementation of Selenium tests.
- Teams adopting Selenium for their test automation efforts.
